You are updating this repository to achieve 100% Python docstring coverage.

## Goal
- Run: uv run interrogate openhands --fail-under 100
- If coverage < 100%, add or improve docstrings until the command passes.
- Make minimal, doc-only changes (no behavior changes).

## Docstring Style Guide
- Use **Google-style** docstrings consistently.
- **One-line summary:** Concise, imperative, ends with a period.
- **Args:** Document purpose, constraints, and behavior when `None` or optional.
- **Returns/Yields:** Describe values and conditions clearly.
- **Raises:** Document all relevant exceptions and why they occur.
- **Classes:** Add an **Attributes:** section for key attributes.
- **Modules:** Include a top-level docstring with purpose, context, and usage.
- **Examples:** Add small, runnable examples where appropriate.
- **Quality checks:**
    - No redundant restating of type hints unless clarifying intent.
    - Keep lines â‰¤ 100 chars.
    - Note side effects (I/O, logging, mutation).
    - For async functions, specify concurrency/ordering assumptions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `uv run interrogate openhands --fail-under 100` passes.
- Docstrings adhere to the style guide.
- No functional changes; CI/tests continue to pass.
