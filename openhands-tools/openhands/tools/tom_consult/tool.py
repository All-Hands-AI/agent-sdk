understanding user intent or task requirements.

This tool allows you to consult Tom agent for personalized guidance \
based on user modeling. Use this when:
- User instructions are vague or unclear
- You need help understanding what the user actually wants
- You want guidance on the best approach for the current task
- You have your own question for Tom agent about the task or user's needs

By default, Tom agent will analyze the user's message. \
Optionally, you can ask a custom question."""

This tool processes conversation history to build and update the user model. \
Use this to:
- Index conversations for future personalization
- Build user preferences and patterns from conversation history
- Update Tom's understanding of the user

This is typically used at the end of a conversation or when explicitly requested."""
