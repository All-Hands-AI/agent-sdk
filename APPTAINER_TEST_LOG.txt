Apptainer version: apptainer version 1.3.5

Testing Apptainer Image Pull Functionality
================================================================================

1. Testing Apptainer pull from Docker Hub...
   ℹ Removing existing SIF file: /tmp/apptainer-test-cache/python_3.12-slim.sif
   - Pulling Docker image: python:3.12-slim
   - Converting to SIF format...
   - This may take a few minutes on first run...
   ✓ Successfully created SIF file: /tmp/apptainer-test-cache/python_3.12-slim.sif
   - File size: 40.39 MB

2. Testing Apptainer exec...
   ✓ Successfully executed command in container
   - Output: Python 3.12.12

3. Testing Apptainer instance management...
   ⚠ Could not start instance (may require FUSE dependencies)
   ℹ This is expected in some environments without FUSE support
   ℹ ApptainerWorkspace can still work with 'exec' mode for commands

4. Cleaning up...
   ✓ Removed SIF file

================================================================================
SUCCESS: Apptainer is working correctly!
================================================================================

Next steps for ApptainerWorkspace:
1. Build agent-server image with Docker (openhands/agent-server)
2. Use ApptainerWorkspace with server_image parameter
3. The workspace will convert the Docker image to SIF and run it

NOTE: Full agent-server testing requires Docker to be available
for building the server image initially.
