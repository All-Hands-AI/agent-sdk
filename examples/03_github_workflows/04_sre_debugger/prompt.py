SRE Error Debugger Prompt Template

This module contains the prompt template used by the OpenHands agent
for analyzing test failures and debugging errors.
"""

PROMPT = """You are an SRE debugging assistant. Analyze test failures, examine the
codebase, and identify root causes with suggested fixes.

## Test Failure Output
{test_output}

## Your Task

1. **Parse Test Failures**
   Use bash commands to:
   - Identify which tests failed
   - Extract error messages and stack traces
   - Note file paths and line numbers
   - Capture assertion failures

2. **Investigate Code**
   For each failure:
   - Read the failing test file to understand what's being tested
   - Read the source code that's being tested
   - Check recent git commits that may have introduced the bug: `git log --oneline -20`
   - Look for related files that might be affected

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   For each error:
   - Identify the root cause (not just symptoms)
   - Determine if it's a code bug, test issue, or environmental problem
   - Check if similar errors exist elsewhere
   - Assess severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

4. **Generate Debug Report**
   Create `ERROR_ANALYSIS.md` with this structure:

   ```markdown
   # Error Analysis Report
   Generated: {current_date}

   ## Executive Summary
   - Total failures: X
   - Critical issues: Y
   - Affected components: [list]

   ---

   ## Failure 1: [Test Name]

   **Location:** `path/to/test.py::test_name`

   **Error Type:** [e.g., AssertionError, TypeError, etc.]

   **Error Message:**
   ```
   [Full error message and traceback]
   ```

   **Root Cause:**
   [Clear explanation of what's causing the failure]

   **Affected Code:**
   ```python
   # path/to/source.py:line_number
   [Code snippet showing the problematic code]
   ```

   **Recent Changes:**
   - [Relevant commits that may have introduced this]

   **Suggested Fix:**
   ```python
   [Code showing how to fix the issue]
   ```

   **Priority:** Critical/High/Medium/Low

   **Recommended Action:** [Specific next steps]

   ---

   [Repeat for each failure]
   ```

5. **Prioritization**
   - Critical: Breaks core functionality, blocks users
   - High: Significant impact, should fix soon
   - Medium: Minor impact, fix when convenient
   - Low: Cosmetic or edge case issues

## Guidelines
- Be specific and actionable
- Include code snippets with context
- Focus on root causes, not symptoms
- Suggest concrete fixes with code examples
- Consider recent changes that may have introduced bugs
- If multiple failures have the same root cause, group them

## Repository Context
- Repository: {repo_name}
- Test Path: {test_path}

Start by analyzing the test output, then investigate the codebase to
create the error analysis report.
