# Routine Maintenance Workflow

This example demonstrates how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated routine maintenance tasks using the OpenHands agent SDK.

## Files

- **`workflow.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow file that can be copied to `.github/workflows/` in your repository
- **`agent_script.py`**: Python script that runs the OpenHands agent with a custom prompt

## Setup

### 1. Copy the workflow file

Copy `workflow.yml` to `.github/workflows/maintenance-task.yml` in your repository:

```bash
cp examples/github_workflows/01_routine_maintenance/workflow.yml .github/workflows/maintenance-task.yml
```

### 2. Configure the workflow

Edit `.github/workflows/maintenance-task.yml` and set your configuration in the `env` section.

You can provide the prompt in two ways (choose one):

**Option A: Direct prompt text (PROMPT_STRING)**
```yaml
jobs:
  run-maintenance-task:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      # Provide prompt as direct text
      PROMPT_STRING: 'Check for any changes that were made over the past week. If they have not been properly documented, create a PR to concisely update the documentation.'
      
      # Optional: Customize other settings
      LLM_MODEL: openhands/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
      # LLM_BASE_URL: 'https://custom-api.example.com'
```

**Option B: Prompt from URL or file (PROMPT_LOCATION)**
```yaml
jobs:
  run-maintenance-task:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      # Provide prompt from URL or file path
      PROMPT_LOCATION: 'https://example.com/prompts/maintenance.txt'
      
      # Optional: Customize other settings
      LLM_MODEL: openhands/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
      # LLM_BASE_URL: 'https://custom-api.example.com'
```

**Note**: Provide either `PROMPT_STRING` or `PROMPT_LOCATION`, not both.

### 3. Configure secrets

Set the following secret in your GitHub repository settings:

- **`LLM_API_KEY`** (required): Your LLM API key
  - Get one from the [OpenHands LLM Provider](https://docs.all-hands.dev/openhands/usage/llms/openhands-llms)

### 4. Test locally (optional)

Before setting up automated runs, test the script locally:

```bash
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export LLM_MODEL="openhands/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"

# Create a test prompt
echo "Check for outdated dependencies in requirements.txt and create a PR to update them" > prompt.txt

# Run the agent
python examples/github_workflows/01_routine_maintenance/agent_script.py prompt.txt
```

## Usage

The workflow configuration in the `env` section is used for both manual and scheduled runs.

### Manual runs

You can trigger the workflow manually and optionally override the default configuration:

1. Go to Actions â†’ "Scheduled Maintenance Task"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. (Optional) Override prompt location or other settings
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Scheduled runs

To enable automated scheduled runs, edit `.github/workflows/maintenance-task.yml` and uncomment the schedule section:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Run at 2 AM UTC every day
    - cron: "0 2 * * *"
```

Customize the cron schedule as needed. See [Cron syntax reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule).

The scheduled runs will use the configuration from the `env` section you set in step 2.

## Example Use Cases

- **Dependency Update:** Check for outdated dependencies in requirements.txt and create a PR to update them if any are found.
- **Test Coverage:** Run the test coverage script and find one place that seems to particularly be lacking tests. If you find any, send a PR improving the test coverage there.
- **Dependency Updates:** Review the README.md and update it to reflect any changes in the codebase since the last update.
- **Linting:** Run linting and formatting checks on all Python files and create a PR with any fixes.
- **Link Validation:** Check all links in Markdown files and create an issue listing any broken links.

## Customization

### Using a custom agent script

You can specify a custom agent script in the workflow inputs:

```yaml
with:
  agent_script: path/to/your/custom_script.py
  prompt_location: path/to/prompt.txt
```

Your custom script should accept a prompt location as a command-line argument and use the OpenHands SDK to run the agent.

### Using remote prompts

You can host prompts remotely (e.g., on GitHub, S3, or any HTTP server) and reference them by URL:

```bash
# Example with GitHub raw URL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/prompts/main/weekly-maintenance.txt

# Example with Gist
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/username/abc123/raw/prompt.txt
```

This allows you to update prompts without modifying the workflow file.
