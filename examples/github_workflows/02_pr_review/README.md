# PR Review Workflow

This example demonstrates how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow for automated pull request reviews using the OpenHands agent SDK. When a PR is labeled with `review-this`, OpenHands will analyze the changes and provide detailed, constructive feedback.

## Files

- **`workflow.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow file that triggers on PR labels
- **`agent_script.py`**: Python script that runs the OpenHands agent for PR review
- **`prompt.py`**: The prompt asking the agent to write the PR review
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file

## Features

- **Automatic Trigger**: Reviews are triggered when the `review-this` label is added to a PR
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes code changes in context of the entire repository
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides structured review comments covering:
  - Overall assessment of changes
  - Code quality and best practices
  - Potential issues and security concerns
  - Specific improvement suggestions
  - Positive feedback on good practices
- **GitHub Integration**: Posts review comments directly to the PR

## Setup

### 1. Copy the workflow file

Copy `workflow.yml` to `.github/workflows/pr-review-by-openhands.yml` in your repository:

```bash
cp examples/github_workflows/02_pr_review/workflow.yml .github/workflows/pr-review-by-openhands.yml
```

### 2. Configure secrets

Set the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

- **`LLM_API_KEY`** (required): Your LLM API key
  - Get one from the [OpenHands LLM Provider](https://docs.all-hands.dev/openhands/usage/llms/openhands-llms)

**Note**: The workflow automatically uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret that's available in all GitHub Actions workflows.

### 3. Customize the workflow (optional)

Edit `.github/workflows/pr-review-by-openhands.yml` to customize the configuration in the `env` section:

```yaml
env:
    # Optional: Use a different LLM model
    LLM_MODEL: openhands/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
    # Optional: Use a custom LLM base URL
    # LLM_BASE_URL: 'https://custom-api.example.com'
```

### 4. Create the review label

Create a `review-this` label in your repository:

1. Go to your repository → Issues → Labels
2. Click "New label"
3. Name: `review-this`
4. Description: `Trigger OpenHands PR review`
5. Color: Choose any color you prefer
6. Click "Create label"

## Usage

### Triggering a Review

To trigger an automated review of a pull request:

1. Open the pull request you want reviewed
2. Add the `review-this` label to the PR
3. The workflow will automatically start and analyze the changes
4. Review comments will be posted to the PR when complete
