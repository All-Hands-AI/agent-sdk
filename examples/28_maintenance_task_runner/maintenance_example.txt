Check if the documentation needs to be updated based on recent changes.

Please:
1. Check when the documentation was last extensively updated (look for commits that modified multiple documentation files or added significant new documentation sections)
2. Review all commits made since that last major documentation update
3. Identify any new user-facing features, API changes, or important updates that should be documented but aren't yet
4. If there are undocumented features, create a draft pull request with proposed documentation for those features, including:
   - Clear explanations of the new features
   - Usage examples where appropriate
   - Updates to relevant existing documentation sections
5. If no documentation updates are needed, create a brief summary report explaining that documentation is up to date
