This security policy is loaded from an absolute path outside the prompt directory.

## Security Requirements

- **DATA_PROTECTION**: All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **ACCESS_CONTROL**: Implement role-based access control for all operations
- **AUDIT_LOGGING**: Log all security-relevant events for compliance
- **INCIDENT_RESPONSE**: Follow established procedures for security incidents

## Compliance Standards

This policy ensures compliance with:
- SOC 2 Type II
- ISO 27001
- GDPR requirements

## Implementation Notes

When using absolute paths, you can:
1. Store security policies in a centralized location
2. Share policies across multiple applications
3. Version control policies separately from application code
4. Implement policy management workflows
