## Test Structure

```

```

## Test Categories

### Integration Tests (`integration`)

End-to-end tests that cover large parts of the code base and are generally slower than other tests.
**CI Execution:** The CI runs those tests nightly. Code changes do not trigger those tests to run. 

### Unit Tests (`cross`, `sdk`, `tools`)

Component-specific tests that prevent regressions in core functionality.

**CI Execution:** The CI runs these tests intelligently based on code changes:
- **SDK Tests** (`sdk/`): Run when changes are detected in `openhands/sdk/**` or `tests/sdk/**`
- **Tools Tests** (`tools/`): Run when changes are detected in `openhands/tools/**` or `tests/tools/**`
- **Cross Tests** (`cross/`): Run when changes are detected in any source code or test files
