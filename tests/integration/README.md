# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests for the agent-sdk that use real LLM calls to test end-to-end functionality.

## Overview

The integration tests are designed to verify that the agent-sdk works correctly with real LLM models by running complete workflows. Each test creates a temporary environment, provides the agent with specific tools, gives it an instruction, and then verifies the results.

## Running Integration Tests

The main test runner script provides flexible options for running integration tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run python tests/integration/run_infer.py --llm-config '{"model": "litellm_proxy/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"}'

# Run a specific test
uv run python tests/integration/run_infer.py --llm-config '{"model": "litellm_proxy/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"}' --eval-ids t01_fix_simple_typo
```

## Automated Testing with GitHub Actions

The integration tests are automatically executed via GitHub Actions using the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/integration-runner.yml`.

### Workflow Triggers

The GitHub workflow runs integration tests in the following scenarios:

1. **Pull Request Labels**: When a PR is labeled with `integration-test`
2. **Manual Trigger**: Via workflow dispatch with a required reason
3. **Scheduled Runs**: Daily at 10:30 PM UTC (cron: `30 22 * * *`)
