"""
Comprehensive unit tests for confirmation mode functionality.

Tests cover:
1. Actions being intercepted in confirmation mode
2. Non-action events (messages) passing through normally
3. Edge cases where no actions are created
4. Implicit confirmation flow (second run() call executing pending actions)
5. Rejection of pending actions
