"""
Unit tests for pause functionality.

Tests the core behavior: pause agent execution between steps.
Key requirements:
1. Multiple pause method calls successively only create one PauseEvent
2. Calling conversation.pause() while conversation.run() is still running in a
   separate thread will pause the agent
3. Calling conversation.run() on an already paused agent will resume it
