'Sorry — I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought. I can, however, give the result and a brief explanation.
78 × 964 = 78 × (1000 − 36) = 78,000 − 2,808 = 75,192.  
75,192 + 17 = 75,209.
Answer: 75,209.

'**Clarifying response format**\n\nI need to provide a short, direct answer along with a brief explanation, carefully showing my calculation steps without revealing my internal thought process. Instead of saying, “let me think,” I should frame it as, “Here’s the answer and how to get there.” I can include minimal calculations, like using long multiplication, but I won\'t share any internal reasoning. The final result is 75,209, calculated as 78 multiplied by 964, using the breakdown of 78 times (1000 minus 36).\n\n**Computing with clarity**\n\nI need to compute the multiplication properly. First, I\'ll calculate 964 times 78, which can be approached as 964 times 80 minus 964 times 2, giving me 75,192. Then, I\'ll add 17 to arrive at 75,209. I want to follow the style guidelines and clarify that I can’t share my internal reasoning process, but I can show the answer and a brief explanation. So, I will present it like this: "Answer: 75,209." I could also outline the calculations for clarity, but I must keep it minimal.\n\n**Clarifying the response**\n\nI need to provide a clear, concise answer while not revealing my internal chain of thought. The final answer is 75,209. I’ll start by saying, "Sorry—I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought. Here is the answer with a concise explanation." The calculation I’ll present is 78 times 964, which can be understood as 78 times (1000 minus 36), leading to 75,192. To clarify, I confirm that 36 times 78 equals 2,808. This keeps it brief while delivering the necessary information!\n\n**Finalizing the answer**\n\nI need to create a clear response without revealing my internal reasoning. I’ll start with: "Sorry—I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought." Then I\'ll present the final result. The calculation I’ll share is straightforward: 78 times 964 plus 17 equals 75,209. I can break it down concisely as follows: 78 times 964 equals 78 times (1000 minus 36), which results in 78,000 minus 2,808, giving 75,192. Then, I simply add 17 to reach 75,209. This keeps it brief and clear!'
