# Task List

1. ✅ Sync branch with latest main
Resolved merge in conversation.py; aligned with EventType; committed
2. ⏳ Bootstrap dev environment
Run make build and ensure everything installs; we have been using uv already
3. ✅ Retrieve PR #41 details and diff
Done previously
4. ✅ Collect and analyze review comments addressed to OpenHands
Done previously
5. 🔄 Implement code changes to address review comments
Removed S3; made persistence event-based; simplified load API; fixed example and tests.
6. 🔄 Run tests & linters
Pre-commit passes; pytest failing due to package import paths not installed in venv; need uv sync / uv run pip install -e? But uv workspace should handle; Makefile build likely needed.
7. ⏳ Commit and push changes
Push branch after tests pass
8. ⏳ Summarize answers to any direct questions (without commenting on PR)
To include here once final
